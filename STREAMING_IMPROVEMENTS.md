# SSE Streaming System - Production Improvements

## Overview

The `stream.go` package has been completely rewritten to handle high-concurrency SSE (Server-Sent Events) connections in a production environment. The previous implementation could get bogged down with many browser tabs, but the new system is designed to scale and perform reliably under load.

## Key Production Features

### 1. Connection Management

- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 1,000 concurrent connections (configurable)
- **Resource Tracking**: Each client tracked with metadata (ID, IP, User-Agent, connection time)
- **Graceful Rejection**: New connections rejected when at capacity with proper HTTP status codes

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Buffered Channels**: Larger channel buffers (50 messages) to handle bursts
- **Non-blocking Broadcasts**: Messages sent with timeouts to prevent blocking
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient client management with sync.Map for high concurrency
- **Memory Management**: Prevents unbounded memory growth

### 3. Health Monitoring

- **Dead Connection Detection**: Automatic cleanup of stale/broken connections
- **Background Cleanup**: Periodic removal of inactive clients (every 60 seconds)
- **Connection Statistics**: Real-time metrics via `/health` endpoint
- **Keep-alive Monitoring**: Track client responsiveness

### 4. Reliability Features

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean closure of all connections on server shutdown
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with proper resource cleanup
- **Context Awareness**: Proper context cancellation for connection management
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts for send operations

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` provides system status including:
  - Active connection count
  - Total messages sent
  - Job queue statistics
  - System health status
- **Structured Logging**: Detailed connection events and diagnostics
- **Metrics Collection**: Atomic counters for performance monitoring

## Configuration Constants

```go
const (
    MaxConcurrentConnections = 1000        // Connection limit
    ClientChannelBuffer     = 50           // Buffer per client
    KeepAliveInterval      = 30 * time.Second  // Keep-alive frequency
    CleanupInterval        = 60 * time.Second  // Cleanup frequency
    ClientSendTimeout      = 5 * time.Second   // Send timeout
)
```

## API Changes

### Before (Old Implementation)

```go
func AddClient(c clientChan)
func RemoveClient(c clientChan)
func Broadcast(msg Message)
```

### After (Production Implementation)

```go
func AddClient(c clientChan, remoteAddr, userAgent string) bool
func RemoveClient(c clientChan)
func Broadcast(msg Message)
func GetConnectionStats() map[string]interface{}
func Shutdown()
```

## New Health Endpoint

**GET `/health`** returns JSON with system status:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1704067200,
  "stream": {
    "active_connections": 25,
    "total_messages": 1500,
    "max_connections": 1000
  },
  "jobs": {
    "total": 10,
    "pending": 2,
    "in_progress": 1,
    "completed": 6,
    "cancelled": 1,
    "error": 0
  }
}
```

## Benefits for High-Load Scenarios

### Problem Solved: Browser Tab Overload

- **Before**: Opening many tabs would slow down the entire server
- **After**: Server maintains performance with connection limits and efficient resource management

### Improved Stability

- Dead connections automatically cleaned up
- Memory usage bounded and predictable
- Server remains responsive under load
- Graceful degradation when at capacity

### Better User Experience

- Faster connection establishment
- More reliable message delivery
- Clear error messages when server is busy
- Proper connection status feedback

## Implementation Details

### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Connection Request**: Client connects to `/stream`
2. **Capacity Check**: Server verifies connection limit
3. **Client Registration**: Client added to connection pool with metadata
4. **Message Streaming**: Real-time job updates sent via SSE
5. **Health Monitoring**: Connection tracked and monitored
6. **Cleanup**: Automatic removal on disconnect or timeout

### Background Services

- **Cleanup Routine**: Runs every 60 seconds to remove stale connections
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of connection health
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Coordinated cleanup on server termination

## Testing Recommendations

To test the improved streaming system:

1. **Load Testing**: Open 50+ browser tabs and monitor `/health`
2. **Connection Limits**: Try to exceed 1,000 connections
3. **Network Issues**: Test with slow/intermittent connections
4. **Server Restart**: Verify graceful shutdown behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:

- Rate limiting per IP address
- WebSocket upgrade option for bidirectional communication
- Message persistence for offline clients
- Connection priority/QoS features
- Advanced metrics and alerting integration

## Migration Notes

The new implementation is backwards compatible with existing frontend code. No changes required to existing SSE clients - they will automatically benefit from the improved performance and reliability.
